- Steps#
- Import required libs
- Import raw data and copy them in test and train variable. Concat them together for feature engineering
## Feature Engineering:
	 Data visualization and handle missing values
	 Column selection
## Lebel Encoding
## Create # X and Y for train model Y = wX + b
## Model selection
## Split X and Y in test and evaluate set
## Define error matrics and tune model parameter
## Fit model and predict sales price !!
## Save result for submission
