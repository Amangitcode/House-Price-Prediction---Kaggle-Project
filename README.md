## Steps#
- Import required libs
- Import raw data and copy them in test and train variable. Concat them together for feature engineering
- Feature Engineering:
	 Data visualization and handle missing values
	 Column selection
- Lebel Encoding
- Create # X and Y for train model Y = wX + b
- Model selection
- Split X and Y in test and evaluate set
- Define error matrics and tune model parameter
- Fit model and predict sales price !!
- Save result for submission
